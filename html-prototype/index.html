          <h5>Goat Debate</h5>
            <blockquote>The question of who is the NBA’s Greatest of All Time (GOAT) intensifies. Usually, the debate is whether it is Lebron or Michael is the GOAT. For Jordan, who won six championships and was six-time MVP, there’s the facts that he never lost in the NBA finals and was always the finals’ MVP. Jordan was the ultimate winner and competitor, whose philosophy was “give no quarter and seek no quarter” from opponents — or even teammates.Perhaps he did not have Jordan’s passion and tenacity for winning from the beginning, but James developed more of that killer instinct over time and was able to display it in many key moments, winning four NBA titles and four MVP awards and 20 all-star appearances. James broke Abdul-Jabbar’s scoring record, a testament to long term consistency and, at 39 years old, playing some of the best basketball of his career. According to Isiah Thomas,<q cite= "https://hoopshype.com/lists/nba-players-saying-lebron-james-is-the-goat/">The best and most “complete” player I have seen in my lifetime is @KingJames on and off the floor. He passed the eye test and the numbers confirm what my eyes have seen in every statistical category. #Goat let it be known!</q></blockquote>
