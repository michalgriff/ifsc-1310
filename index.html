    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
<p> I initially started this assignment without a clear direction of how I wanted to approach. Upon downloading the reference file, I had a sense of how to start. As I began this process, it ultimately got faster and easier. I decided to go with the Segway Project because many people told me they were doing the SpaceX project. 
</p>


<p> The site features three pages being a home page, a faqs page, and an about page. There is a constant navigation element that has directories to these three pages. The footer can return the user to the top of a page and an email link to my email. 
</p>


<p>I got my first review from a classmate. They said that my draft lacked interactibility as the link had no hover functionality. Adding this functionality made my site feel more “alive”. I also didn’t have an external link for the Segway Website. In the final draft, I added this as well.

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is a relatively new concept when it comes to technology. While commonplace now, Progressive Enhancement has come a long way. Its growth has replaced graceful degradation which focuses on the browser’s ability to at least be passable as functioning.</p>


<p>Progressive Enhancement focuses on the content in a site. Without the content, a website is essentially nothing. The analogy of a Peanut M&M is used to explain the progressive enhancement approach: content as the peanut, CSS as the chocolate coating, and JavaScript as the hard candy shell. Each layer caters to different user capabilities, ensuring a basic experience for all while enhancing it for those with more advanced browsers. Progressive enhancement is touted for its simplicity and adherence to web standards.</p>
